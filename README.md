# Project Title:
Automated Discord Poll Bot

# Project Description:
This project involves the creation of an automated Discord bot designed to facilitate the creation, management, and execution of polls within a Discord server. The bot allows users to create polls using a specific command format, and it dynamically handles the poll's lifecycle from creation to the display of results. The bot supports multiple poll options, ensures only valid reactions are counted, and provides a real-time countdown until the poll's closure.

# Key Features:

# Command-based Poll Creation: 
Users can initiate a poll using a structured command that includes the poll name, question, options, and countdown time.
# Reaction Handling: 
The bot adds reactions corresponding to poll options and manages user votes to ensure each user can only vote once.
# Real-time Countdown: 
A background task updates the poll message to show the remaining time until the poll ends.
# Automated Result Calculation: 
Upon poll completion, the bot calculates and displays the results as percentages and vote counts for each option.
# Error Handling: 
Validation functions ensure that all input parameters are correctly formatted before creating a poll.
# Skills Used:
# Python Programming: 
Utilized for scripting the bot logic, handling Discord API interactions, and implementing asynchronous tasks.
# Discord.py Library: 
Used to interface with the Discord API, manage events, send and edit messages, and handle reactions.
# Asynchronous Programming: 
Employed for managing concurrent tasks such as real-time countdown updates and reaction handling.
# Error Handling and Validation: 
Implemented to ensure robustness and reliability of poll creation and management.
# Datetime Manipulation: 
Used for managing countdown timers and scheduling tasks.
# API Interaction: 
Managed interactions with Discord's API for fetching channels, messages, and member details.
